Note that for the task of video denoising, the division of training and test datasets from Vimeo-90K are different from those of TOFlow by excluding the test sequences that have similar contents with those of training sequences, and all deep learning-based competing methods are re-trained using the same training and test datasets.

For the task of video super-resolution, we use the same train training and test datasets from Vimeo-90K with those of TOFlow to facilitate the comparisons with other competing video super-resolution methods.
